This is my files for my own keyboard layout based on the colemac-mod-dh layout.

The specification lies in the files `tage*.json`. They should be compiled with the program `klfc`.

### Windows installation

To install on Windows, you need to download "Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creater" (which in turn requires .net3.5).
You'll then need to import the compiled .klc file into that program and build an installer which you then can run to install the layout.
Lastly, you should add the layout in settings.

If you have trouble importing the .klc file you might need to convert it to some old windows encoding and with dos linebrakes.
